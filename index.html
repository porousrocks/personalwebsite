          I'm a master's student at the Department of Computer Science at National Cheng Kung University, Taiwan. My research interests lie in the field of Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning, particularly in representation learning for language understanding and generation. During my master's, I published work on latent space control for long text generation. My thesis introduced the world’s largest dataset containing rich linguistic annotation on the text and proposed a language representation with entity and relation signal.
            Before NCKU, I worked in Academia Sinica, Taiwan, and developed spatiotemporal applications. I graduated from National Taiwan University (NTU), the top 1 university in Taiwan, with a Bachelor's degree in Geography. I received Taiwan Government Study-Aboard Scholarship in 2021.
